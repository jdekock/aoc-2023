Advent of Code[^aoc] solutions written in Swift using the [Advent of Code Swift Starter Project][project] from Apple.

For every day there is a test to execute the code with test input provided for each challenge. This can be done via the `swift test` command. To execute the code against real data you can use the `swift run -c release AdventOfCode --benchmark 3` command, where the number corresponds with the day you want to execute.
